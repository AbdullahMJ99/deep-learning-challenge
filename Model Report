# Model Report

# Purpose:
Predict the accuracy in classifcation to find whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.


# Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
all the other columns
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
EIN and Name columns

# Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
8 layers
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
No
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
adding more layers and removing columns


# Summarize and recommendation:
Overall, the deep learning model was around 70% accurate in predicting the problem. Using a model with greater correlation between input and output would likely result in higher prediction accuracy. Data clean up would be reccomended.
